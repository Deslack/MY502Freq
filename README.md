This is a list of Amateur (Ham) Radio Frequency list that I have compiled and exported to CSV for use with your Radio or Codeplug programming software, such as CHIRP.

Instead of solely using the repeater's callsign, I decided to add some annotation to denote which state the repeater is in, for ease of narrowing list of repeaters in case one is visiting.

Since the official state code in Malaysia as per ISO3166-2 are mere digits and not as cool nor as helpful as shortform alphabetic characters like in the United States, I stumbled upon Statoids (https://statoids.com/umy.html)

|      State      |  HASC |
|:---------------:|:-----:|
| Johor           | MY.JH |
| Kedah           | MY.KH |
| Kelantan        | MY.KN |
| Kuala Lumpur    | MY.KL |
| Labuan          | MY.LA |
| Melaka          | MY.ME |
| Negeri Sembilan | MY.NS |
| Pahang          | MY.PH |
| Perak           | MY.PK |
| Perlis          | MY.PL |
| Pulau Pinang    | MY.PG |
| Putrajaya       | MY.PJ |
| Sabah           | MY.SA |
| Sarawak         | MY.SK |
| Selangor        | MY.SL |
| Terengganu      | MY.TE |

I used the two-letter abbreviations, and appended a character denoting the club ownership of the repeater, linking or transnational in uppercase, local in lowercase.

| Letter | Ownership                                                        | Website                   |

I set them up for my Quansheng UV-K5(8) handheld radio for programming via the excellent CHIRP (https://chirpmyradio.com/).

Well have fun from me 9W2DSL, 73.
